The goal of this project is to build a weather analytics platform that automates the collection, processing, and analysis of weather data for agricultural decision-making. The project aims to:

□ Automate Daily Weather Data Collection: Use Apache Airflow via Astro CLI to schedule automatic data ingestion from the Weatherstack API, ensuring that weather information is updated every day without manual input.

□ Provide Accurate, Location-Specific Weather Insights: Deliver actionable, real-time weather data that is relevant to each farm’s specific geographic location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.

□ Enhance Decision-Making for Farmers: Enable farmers to make data-driven decisions about irrigation, planting, and harvesting based on up-to-date weather conditions.

□ Store and Analyze Historical Data: Retain weather data in a PostgreSQL database for trend analysis and historical weather pattern reviews, giving farmers the ability to track weather over time and adjust their strategies accordingly.
